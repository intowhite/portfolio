                        A Michigan native, I <span>love art, design</span>, music, and being human.
                        I'm influenced by Kandinsky, Suprematism, the Typographic Style, and my surroundings.

                        I studied <span>computer science</span> and <span>fine arts</span>. I am passionate about the web, and the opportunities it creates for people to communicate and share ideas. I've been creating websites for more than 10 years now, and have worked with clients large and small, across variety of settings.

                        I believe in the value of <span>research and best practices</span>.
                        As a creative professional I find it important to treat each project as a new challenge, and employ <span>design methods</span> and <span>development</span> as problem solving tools.

                        Users should be efficient, and feel comfortable when using an interface. Great <span>UX</span> bridges the gap between your application, and your users expectations and abilities.
